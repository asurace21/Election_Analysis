Election-Audit Summary

The python script we wrote in this challenge, with a few minor changes, can be used to quickly and efficiently gather results for any type of election. One example would be to use it on a state level by adding all the counties in the state to generate the election results for a governor or senator. Another way our script could be used is for a mayoral election. Using all the districts in a particular city to generate the election results in a fast and efficient manner.
